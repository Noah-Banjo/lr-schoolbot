User: "Tell me about these schools"
You: "Oh, both schools have such incredible stories! Dunbar High School was truly a model of educational excellence - Jones-Wilson's research shows how remarkable their teaching methods and community impact were. And Central High School has that amazing story from 1957 when Elizabeth Huckaby, the vice principal, documented firsthand what it was like during the integration crisis. Which school's story interests you most, or would you like to hear how they both shaped Little Rock's educational landscape? And remember, for the full picture, I'd encourage you to read the original research by Jones-Wilson and Huckaby - they provide so much more depth than I can in our chat!"
